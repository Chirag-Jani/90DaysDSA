For day-31 to day-45 ðŸ‘‡

Concepts to learn: 
    1. Searching
    2. Sorting
        a. bubble sort
        b. insertion sort
        c. selection sort
        d. merge sort
        e. quick sort
    3. Hashmaps
    4. Trees
    5. Heaps
    6. Sliding Window (It's a Question)

_____________________________

As I already know Searching and Sorting, will start from Trees.

20,21,22,46,47 : Sorting algorithms (5 videos)

92-107 : Trees (16 videos)
108-117 : BST (10 videos)
118-128 : Questions, Set & Multisets (11 videos)
    - 84, 124, 125 and 126 are Sliding Window Challanges

129-134 : Heaps (6 videos)

135-142 : Hashmaps (8 videos)

________________________________________________________________________________________

Day 31 - 33

- Watch and Code Sorting algorithms (I should be able to code even in my sleep.)
- See some videos on searching (maybe like Binary Search) and complete it.

_____________________________

Day 34 - 36

- Complete Hashmaps (Watch videos and do some questions on Leetcode as well if possible.)
    - 4 videos on day 35
    - 4 videos on day 36
    - solve some problems on Leetcode (at least 2)

_____________________________

Day 37 - 42

- Learn Trees on day-37 to day-39
- Learn BST on day-40 and day-42

(Learn Set & Multisets if time permits )

_____________________________

Day 43 - 45

Complete Heaps and Sliding Window
    - watch 4 videos on day 43
    - watch 2 videos + 1-2 questions of Heaps on Leetcode day 44
    - learn Sliding Window on day 45

Things I skipped because of urgent work.

- 106, 107, 110, 111, 113, 115, 116, 117 <- these are the videos skipped

- Revise Hashmaps.

- Code these questions:

  - Flaten a binary tree
  - nodes at distance K in binary tree
  - Search and delete in Binary Search Tree
  - Build Balanced BST from sorted array
  - Zig Zag traversal of Binary Search Tree
  - All of the Heaps

- Learn Set & Multisets
