-> Started Learning Trees:
    - Creating a tree,
    - pre-Order traversal
    - in-Order traversal
    - post-Order traversal

-> Build tree from given preOrder and inOrder sequence
-> Build tree from given postOrder and inOrder sequence

-> Level Order Traversal
    - sum at Kth level of a binary tree.

-> Count all the nodes and sum of all nodes in a binary tree
