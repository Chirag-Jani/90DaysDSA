Striver's DP seriese.
- length:- 60 videos
- topics? 
    - Tabulation
    - Memoization
- The best ever (promised)

______________________

DP1:-

- We use a array to store the results of previous recursion calls so that we do not "Override the Subproblems" by doing recursive call to the same problem.

- We use table or a Map to store the values.

- Optimising space complexity is the most important thing to know here.

Q. Fibonacci seriese problem using DP (without recursion and even using less space complexity)
______________________

DP2:-

- How to understand that this is a DP problem??
WHEN QUESTION GOES LIKE...

    - return the total no. of ways
    - there are multiple ways but return maximum or minimum
    - whenever "Try all posible ways" comes, recursion comes.

.. because in these type of problems we tend to apply recursion.

- First try to figure out if the problem is recursion problem and then go to DP from that.

While trying to solve prblems by DP,

i. Try to represent the problem in forms of index.
ii. do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement.
iii. sum up all the stuffs -> Count all ways
iv. Min. of all stuffs -> find min.
v. Max. of all stuffs -> find max.

Q. Climbing staires problem
 - this problem got converted into Fibonacci problem by applying the above steps, so didn't code it.

DP3:-

- there are a lot of things to take notes of (rewatch the 3rd tutorial for that)

Q. Frog Jump using,
    - Memoization
    - Tabulation
    - Space Optimization
