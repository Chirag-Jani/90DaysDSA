    - Memoization
- The best ever (promised)

DP1:-

- We use a array to store the results of previous recursion calls so that we do not "Override the Subproblems" by doing recursive call to the same problem.

- We use table or a Map to store the values.

- Optimising space complexity is the most important thing to know here.

- Solved Fibonacci seriese problem using DP (without recursion and even using less space complexity)

DP2:-
