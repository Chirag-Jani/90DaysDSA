Solved some basic questions of binary search like -

1. Finding  1st and Last occurance of an element in an array.
2. total number of occurance of an element.
3. Peak in a Mountain Array.

- Also learned about Space complexity (as I continued from array and didn't learn about it.)
    - when space complexity is affected?
    - constant and variable space allocation.
