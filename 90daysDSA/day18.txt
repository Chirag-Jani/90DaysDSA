Noticed that I am solving most of problems in O(n) and upper time complexity.
Needed to learn Binery Search so that I can improve time complexity of quetions.

Started learning about binary search from love babbar.

learned about -
- approach
- how it is better?
- when can we use?
- some basic quetions like finding indexes in an array.
- log(n) time complexity explanation.
