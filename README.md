# 90DaysDSA

To see more details about what I learned and how I learned, see day specific text file in the folder.

Day 1 -
I was already doing DSA so, Basics of Arrays, Strings, Pointers, Bit Manipulation Done.

---

Day 2 -
Started following roadmap. Started Recursion with theory and basic questions (more details regarding questions and it's code are in above folder.

Questions:

1. sum till nth term
2. factorial of a number
3. n raised to the power k
4. print numbers in increasing order
5. print numbers in decreasing order
6. nth term of Fibonacci sequence

---

Day 3 -
Solved some more questions on Recursion to clear the fundamentals.

1. Check if array is sorted or not. sortedArray.cpp
2. First and last occurance of an element. firstAndLast.cpp

- 7problems

3. reverse a string. reverseString.cpp
4. Move all 'x' to the end. moveX.cpp
5. remove all duplicates from the string. removDups.cpp
6. replace 'pi' with '3.14' in a string. replacePi.cpp
7. tower of hanoi. toh.cpp
8. Print all subsequences. subSeq.cpp
9. Print all subsequences with their ASCII code. subSeq_ascii.cpp

Day 4 -
Advance questions on recursion.

1. Get all the permutations of a string. (permutations.cpp)
2. Get all the paths to reach e from s.(countPaths.cpp)
3. Get number of paths to reach e from s in a maze.(mazePaths.cpp)
4. Tiling problem (tilingProblem.cpp)
5. Pairing friends (friendsPairing.cpp)
6. Knap sack problem (knapSack.cpp)

---

Day 5 -
Started learning about Back tracking.

learned basics and did one questinon on "rat in a maze"

---

Day 6 -

learned more about backtracking and did few questions.

1. permutations of an array
2. N - queen problem

---

Day 7 -

Solved & Understood some more problems on recursion.

-> Striver's SDE sheet questions

1. Subset (watched explanation only, didn't code)
2. Subset 2 (watched explanation only, didn't code)
3. Rat in a maze but with Printing the direction in which the Rat moves. (watched explanation only, didn't code)

-> Learned about C++ STL (from love babbar)

1. Vectors
2. List
3. Set

-> Making the recursive tree is the first step of solving problem.
a. make recursive tree.
b. write pseudo code.
c. write the code.

---

Day 8 -

-> Few more questions on Recursion

1. Reverse a string (again because concept clearing ) (recursion\leetcode_problems\reverseString.cpp)

2. Predict the Winner (leetcode - Medium) (predictWinner.cpp)
   -> could not code entirely but developed recursive tree and logic as well.

link : https://leetcode.com/problems/predict-the-winner/

---

Day 9 -
-> solved few questions from striver's SDE sheed (by watching his explanation)

=> Recursion

1. Combinational Sum. (coded with reference) (combinationalSum.cpp)

2. Combinational Sum 2. (coded with reference) (combinationalSum2.cpp)

---

Day 10 -

3 questions on backtracking from Striver's SDE sheet.

1. Permutations ( 2 approaches )
2. N Queen problem
3. Sudoku Solver

-> Getting better idea about vectors and logic building with time and understanding approaches.

-------------------------- 2 Parts ( Time & Space complexity, Recursion & Backtracking ) Done from Challange ---------------------------

Day 11 -

-> Arrays, SubArrays, SubSequences and solved apna college problems.

Apna College questions:

1. Max till i in an array.
2. Record Breaking day (google kickstart question).
3. Sum of all subarrays.
4. subarray with a given sum (return starting and ending index).
5. longest subarray length.
6. First repeting element in an array.
7. smallest missing positive integer.
8. Print all subarrays.
9. Maximum subarray sum. (bruteforce, optimised and kadane's algorithm)
