# 90DaysDSA

Day 1 - 
I was already doing DSA so, Basics of Arrays, Strings, Pointers, Bit Manipulation Done.

Day 2 - 
Started following roadmap. Started Recursion with theory and basic questions (more details regarding questions and it's code are in above folder. 

Questions:
1. sum till nth term
2. factorial of a number
3. n raised to the power k
4. print numbers in increasing order
5. print numbers in decreasing order
6. nth term of Fibonacci sequence 

Day 3 -
Solved some more questions on Recursion to clear the fundamentals.

1. Check if array is sorted or not. sortedArray.cpp
2. First and last occurance of an element.  firstAndLast.cpp

- 7problems

3. reverse a string. reverseString.cpp
4. Move all 'x' to the end. moveX.cpp
5. remove all duplicates from the string. removDups.cpp
6. replace 'pi' with '3.14' in a string. replacePi.cpp
7. tower of hanoi. toh.cpp
8. Print all subsequences. subSeq.cpp
9. Print all subsequences with their ASCII code. subSeq_ascii.cpp
